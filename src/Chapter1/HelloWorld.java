//    example in Section 1.4.
//            1. Type in the hello world program, then compile and run it.
//            2. Add a print statement that displays a second message after the \Hello,
//    World!". Say something witty like, \How are you?" Compile and run
//    the program again.
//3. Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again.
//    The new comment should not aect the result.
